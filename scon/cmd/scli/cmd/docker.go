To build and run containers and manage anything related to Docker, use the "docker" command directly from macOS:
    docker
There is no need to use machines if you only want to use Docker.

For example, to start an example container:
    docker run -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
Then visit http://localhost.

Compose and buildx are also included:
    docker compose
    docker buildx

To migrate containers, volumes, and images from Docker Desktop:
    orb migrate docker

OrbStack's cluster is configured as the "orbstack" context.
To prevent OrbStack from changing the active Docker context automatically:
	orb config set docker.set_context false
