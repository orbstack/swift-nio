/// A self uninstaller which performs the logical equivalent of the non-existent `SMJobUnbless`.
///
/// Because Apple does not provide an API to perform an "unbless" operation, the technique used here relies on a few key behaviors:
///  - To deregister the helper tool with launchd, the `launchctl` command line utility which ships with macOS is used
///     - The `unload` command used is publicly documented
///  - An assumption that this helper tool when installed is located at `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/<helper_tool_name>`
///     - While this location is not documented in `SMJobBless`, it is used in Apple's EvenBetterAuthorizationSample `Uninstall.sh` script
///     - This is used to determine if this helper tool is in fact running from the blessed location
///  - To remove the `launchd` property list, its location is assumed to be `/Library/LaunchDaemons/<helper_tool_name>.plist`
///     - While this location is not documented in `SMJobBless`, it is used in Apple's EvenBetterAuthorizationSample `Uninstall.sh` script
